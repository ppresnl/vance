# THE BRAZILIAN PRIMAL: FINAL CONTENT BIBLE
*Tactical Operating System for the Creative Team*

---

## 1. THE VISUAL LANGUAGE GUIDELINE
**Aesthetic:** *Tropical Modernism x Gritty Reality*
**Core Vibe:** "The Philosopher in the Jungle."
**Color Palette:** Deep Jungle Greens, Wet Concrete Grey, Warm Earth Tones (Mud, Rust).
**Skin Tones:** Rich, warm, sweaty (emphasize effort).
**Anti-Reference:** No neon, no "gym shark" brights, no flat studio lighting.

### A. Camera & Grading
*   **The "Green & Grain" Look:** Every video must simulate 16mm film.
    *   **Grain:** Moderate to heavy (texture > sharpness).
    *   **Contrast:** High contrast, but lift the blacks (faded shadows).
    *   **Halation:** Subtle red blooming around bright light sources (sun/sweat).
*   **Aspect Ratio:** 2.35:1 Letterbox within the 9:16 frame (adds cinema weight) OR full 9:16 with heavy vignetting.

### B. Framing Strategy (The Dichotomy)
We alternate between two extremes. Never "mid-shots."
1.  **The Wide (Insignificance):** Tiny human vs. Giant Concrete Wall / Giant Jungle. Center composition. Static shot.
2.  **The Macro (The Struggle):** Extreme close-up. Veins on a forearm, a drop of sweat, calloused fingers gripping a ledge.

### C. Editing Pacing ("The Breath")
1.  **The Hook (0-3s):** Rapid sensory cuts (Texture -> Sound -> Impact).
2.  **The Breath (3-8s):** Long, wide static shot. Let the viewer absorb the danger.
3.  **The Action:** Cuts land on the *beat* of the diegetic sound (footsteps/breathing), not the music.

### D. Typography
*   **Font:** Serif (*EB Garamond*) or Classic Mono (*Courier New*).
*   **Color:** Cinematic Yellow (#FFFF00) with slight drop shadow.
*   **Placement:** Dead center for impact words ("FEAR"), Lower third for narrative.

## 4. CAPTION STRATEGY: THE PHILOSOPHER-KING
*Structure: The Koan -> The Lesson -> The Call to Arms.*

**The Voice:**
*   Stoic, not angry.
*   Certain, not arrogant.
*   "I" for experience, "You" for challenge.

**Example 1 (The Koan):**
"The body will become whatever you force it to be."
**The Lesson:**
"If you sit in a chair for 8 hours, you are training to be a chair. If you hang, crawl, and sprint, you are training to be human. Adaptation is indifferent. It just says 'Yes'."
**Call to Arms:**
"Do not let the chair win today."

**Example 2 (The Koan):**
"Fear is a compass."
**The Lesson:**
"We avoid the things that scare us, but those are the exact coordinates of our growth. The shaking hand is just the body preparing for action."
**Call to Arms:**
"Find North."

**Subtitle Rules:**
*   **English Text on Screen** (Universal hook).
*   **Portuguese Audio** (Authentic emotion).
*   **Fonts:** Classic Serif. Yellow.

## 5. THE "NO-GO" LIST (BRAINROT AVOIDANCE)
*We do NOT do these.*

1.  **No "Trend Dancing":** Unless it's a Capoeira flow. No TikTok dances.
2.  **No "Prank" Content:** We do not annoy strangers for views. We are "Silent Professionals."
3.  **No Fake Falls:** The "Fail Reel" is real pain. We don't simulate danger.
4.  **No Hyper-Hype Editing:** No MrBeast subtitles, no airhorns, no "Wait for the end!" text.
5.  **No "Gym Bro" Culture:** No flexing in mirrors with bright lights. We flex by *doing*.
6.  **No Political Rants:** We talk about internal politics (the mind), not external.
7.  **No Complaining:** We suffer silently. Complaining breaches the Stoic contract.

**FINAL NOTE:**
The goal is not to be an "Influencer." The goal is to be a **Modern Myth**.
Make it look like a documentary about the last man on earth, training to restart civilization.
