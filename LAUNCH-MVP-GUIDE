# LAUNCH-MVP-GUIDE-AUDITED.md: The "Cinema-Grade" Athlete Protocol (2026 Edition)

## 1. The Strategy: "One Bullet, Not a Shotgun"

**The Verdict: Kill the 3x3 Grid.**

*   **The Myth:** "I need 9 posts so my profile looks full."
    *   *Reality (2026):* 99.9% of traffic discovers you on the FYP (For You Page). They do not see your grid until *after* you have hooked them.
    *   *The Agency Standard:* Nike doesn't dump 9 mediocre posts. They drop **ONE** film that stops the world.
    *   *The Pivot:* Launch with **ONE** masterpiece (The Trailer). The grid can be empty. If the trailer is undeniable, they will follow to see what happens next.
    *   *Scarcity = Status:* A profile with 1 incredible video and 10k views signals "I just arrived and I am dangerous." A profile with 9 mid-tier posts signals "I am trying too hard."

## 2. Production Audit: "Cinema Mode" Only

**Philosophy:** If it looks like a "Content Creator" made it, delete it. If it looks like a documentary or a Nike ad, post it.

*   **Camera:** **iPhone 15 Pro Max (or newer)** - *Non-negotiable for Log.*
    *   *Format:* **ProRes Log**. This is the only way to get cinema-grade color grading. Do not bake in the "Standard" iPhone look.
    *   *Frame Rate:* **24fps (The Hollywood Standard)**. Never 30fps. Never 60fps (unless slow-mo).
    *   *Shutter Speed:* Lock at 1/48 (or 1/50). This creates natural motion blur. (Requires ND Filter).
*   **The "Anti-Cringe" Rules:**
    *   **NO** Ring Lights. (Reflected rings in eyes = amateur). Use grand, soft window light or negative fill.
    *   **NO** "Pointing at floating text" bubbles.
    *   **NO** "Trending Audio" dances.
    *   **NO** CapCut "Shake" effects or cheesy transitions.
    *   **NO** Selfie-mode ranting videos.

## 3. The Launch Timeline: Tease -> Drop -> Sustain

**Phase 1: The Tease (Day -2)**
*   **Asset:** A single cryptic Story or Static Image.
*   **Visual:** A silhouette, a texture (sweat/blood/chalk), or a date.
*   **Audio:** Silence or a low frequency hum.
*   **Goal:** Wake up the existing network. "Something is coming."

**Phase 2: The Drop (Day 0)**
*   **Asset:** **THE TRAILER (The "Manifesto")**
*   **Concept:** Who are you? What is the enemy?
*   **Visual Spec:**
    *   *The Hook (0-3s):* High-fidelity sound design (a match strike, a heavy breath, a slam). Visual contrast (pure black to blinding light).
    *   *The Body (3-15s):* Fast cuts of *competence*. You moving. You working. No talking. Just the sound of effort.
    *   *The Turn (15-30s):* Voiceover (recorded independently, EQ'd rich and deep). "They told us to stay inside. We went into the jungle."
*   **Caption:** Minimalist. "We begin. [Date]. #BrazilianPrimal"

**Phase 3: The Sustain (Day 1 - Day 14)**
*   **Frequency:** 2 High-Quality Reels per week. Quality > Quantity.
*   **Asset Types:**
    *   **The Statement:** 15s clip. You speaking a controversial truth about fitness/life directly to camera. 50mm lens selection (2x or 3x zoom), eye level.
    *   **The Proof:** Raw, uncut footage of a feat of strength. No music. Just ASMR of the movement. Proves you aren't "hiding" behind edits.

## 4. Minimum Viable Signal (MVS) Setup

*   **The "Cinema" Kit:**
    *   **Lens:** Moment 58mm Tele (or iPhone 5x Telephoto). Compression = status. Wide angle = distortion/chaos.
    *   **ND Filter:** Variable ND (1-5 stops) to keep shutter at 1/48 while outdoors.
    *   **Audio:** DJI Mic 2 (32-bit float recording - impossible to clip). Hidden under shirt.
*   **The "Color" Workflow (DaVinci Resolve / LumaFusion):**
    *   Apply a "Film Print Emulation" LUT (Kodak 2383).
    *   Grain: Add 35mm film grain overlay.
    *   Halation: Subtle bloom on highlights (makes digital look analog).

## 5. Zero-Fluff Metric Set (The "Nike" Dashboard)

**Ignore:** Follower Count. (Vanity).
**Ignore:** Likes. (Cheap dopamine).

**The Only Metrics That Matter:**

1.  **Retention at 3 seconds:**
    *   *Goal:* >70%. Did the visual arrest them instantly?
2.  **Average Watch Time:**
    *   *Goal:* >90% of total video length. Did they watch the movie to the end?
3.  **"Shares to Story":**
    *   *The Ultimate Signal:* Someone putting YOUR face on THEIR profile. This is the highest form of endorsement.
    *   *Target:* 1 Share per 100 Views.
