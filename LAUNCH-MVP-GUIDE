# AUTHENTIC MVP STRATEGY: The Antidote to "Nike Commercials"

> **Mission:** Prove competence through continuity. Connect through imperfection. Grow through resonance, not stimulation.
> **Target Audience:** The "Lost Boy" and the quiet practitioner. They trust scars, not polish.

## 1. The 1-Week Content Menu (20k/10k Account)

**Logic:** This schedule balances **Authority** (Purist), **Intimacy** (Diarist), and **Community** (Connector). It moves the audience from passive observation to active trust.

| Day | Perspective | Format/Concept | The "Vibe" |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mon** | **DIARIST** | **The "Nothing" Morning**<br>Static tripod. 5 AM. Eating in silence. No music. The sound of the spoon hitting the bowl.<br>*Caption:* "The brain isn't on yet. Just the body moving because it has to." | *Discipline is boring/robotic.* |
| **Tue** | **PURIST** | **The "Check" (Mental Prep)**<br>Wide shot. Standing still before the big move/lift. 30s of twitching, visualizing, breathing. Do the move or cut right before.<br>*Caption:* No caption or just "Visualizing." | *Tension. Mastery is mental.* |
| **Wed** | **CONNECTOR** | **The "Walk and Talk"**<br>Handheld, walking outside. No jump cuts. Address a specific DM or a feeling (e.g., "Why I almost quit last month").<br>*Message:* "I'm not a guru on a pedestal; I'm a big brother on the path." | *Peer-to-peer. Imperfect.* |
| **Thu** | **PURIST** | **The "Heavy" Landing (or Lift)**<br>Low angle. Tripod. The raw sound of impact/strain. Heavy breathing. No music covering the effort.<br>*Focus:* Gravity and Physics. | *Undeniable reality.* |
| **Fri** | **DIARIST** | **The "Car Confessional"**<br>Immediately post-work/workout. Sweat drying. Messy hair. The raw, endorphin-dumped truth.<br>*Hook:* "That was terrible. I hated every second." | *Vulnerability.* |
| **Sat** | **CONNECTOR** | **The Q&A (Over the Shoulder)**<br>Screen record a real DM (blur name). Answer it with "I used to feel this too," not "Here is the solution."<br>*Goal:* Validate the pain first. | *Empathy.* |
| **Sun** | **DIARIST** | **The "Lights Out" Audit**<br>Dark room. Lying in bed. Brief review of the week. "Did I do what I said I would?"<br>*Ending:* "Back at it tomorrow." | *Accountability.* |

## 2. Production Rules: The "Anti-Algorithm" Bible

These rules exist to break the "commercial" filter. If it looks like an ad, they scroll. If it looks like a FaceTime call or a security camera feed, they stop.

### 🚫 The "HARD NO" List
1.  **NO Music Overlays:** Unless it's ambient/environmental. The sound of the gym, the wind, or silence is the soundtrack.
2.  **NO Jump Cuts:** If you stumble on a word, keep it. If you pause to think, keep it. Continuity = Trust.
3.  **NO "Hook" Intros:** Never say "Hey guys" or "Wait for the end." Start mid-action or mid-thought.
4.  **NO Filters/Color Grading:** The "ugly" lighting of a gym or office is more real than a cinema LUT.
5.  **NO "Reaction" Posing:** After a stunt/lift, walk away or check your hands. Don't look at the camera and scream "Let's go!"

### ✅ The "MUST DO" List
1.  **Audio is King:** Emphasize *texture* sounds (chalk, shoes screeching, wind, breath).
2.  **Static or Handheld Only:** Use a tripod (The Observer) or your hand (The Friend). No gimbals. No drones.
3.  **The "Paused" Scroll:** Use stillness/silence to disrupt the chaotic feed. Be the monolith.
4.  **Context:** Show the setup and the failure, not just the highlight.

## 3. The Success Metric: Deep Engagement > Views

We are pivoting from **"Vanity Metrics"** (Views, Likes) to **"Resonance Metrics"**.

### Primary Metric: **Comment Length & Quality**
*   **The Goal:** We don't want "Fire emoji" or "Great vid."
*   **The Win:** We want paragraphs. We want stories. "I needed to hear this today because..." or "This reminds me of when I..."
*   **Why:** A paragraph comment is a person who has bought into the *culture*, not just the clip.

### Secondary Metric: **DM Volume**
*   **The Goal:** People treating DMs like a confession booth or a direct line to a mentor.
*   **The Win:** "I've never told anyone this, but..."
*   **Strategy:** Reply with voice notes to supercharge this connection.

### Tertiary Metric: **Average View Duration (AVD)**
*   **The Goal:** High retention on "boring" videos.
*   **The Win:** People watching a 45-second clip of you just breathing or visualizing. This signals they are captivated by *you*, not the editing.
