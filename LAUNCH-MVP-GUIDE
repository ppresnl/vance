# LAUNCH-MVP-GUIDE.md: The "Brazilian Primal" Minimum Viable Launch

## 1. Psychology of the Start: "The Grid Effect"

**The Verdict: Launch with 9 Posts.**

*   **Why 9?** When a user visits your profile after seeing a Reel, they see a 3x3 grid.
    *   **Less than 9:** Looks like a ghost town or a scam. The scroll stops too early.
    *   **Exactly 9:** Fills the initial viewport. It signals: "This is a real, established world. I can binge this."
    *   **The Follow Trigger:** Users follow because of *future* value based on *past* consistency. A full 9-grid proves the aesthetic isn't a fluke; it's a commitment.

**The 3x3 Grid Matrix:**
*   **Top Row (The Hook):** 3 High-Voltage Reels (Manifesto, Skill, Vibe).
*   **Middle Row (The Meat):** 3 Educational/Insight Carousels (Text-heavy "Tropical Noir" aesthetic).
*   **Bottom Row (The Foundation):** 3 Static Lifestyle/Atmosphere shots (Black and white jungle gym, raw food, sweat).

## 2. Minimum Production Kit: "Tropical Noir" Agile Setup

**Philosophy:** If it doesn't fit in a gym bag, it stays home. High contrast, low noise.

*   **Camera:** **iPhone 13 Pro (or newer)**
    *   *Setting:* 4K at 24fps (Cinematic Mode for shallow depth of field).
    *   *Exposure:* Lock exposure -0.7 to -1.0 EV. "Tropical Noir" lives in the shadows. Crushed blacks > blown highlights.
*   **Audio:** **RØDE VideoMic Me-L (or Wireless GO II if budget allows)**
    *   Direct lightning port connection. No batteries to charge (for Me-L).
    *   *Why:* Bad audio kills "Vibe" faster than bad lighting.
*   **Lighting:** **Godox M1 (or generic RGB Pocket Light)**
    *   *Use case:* Rim light at night or fill light in harsh sun.
    *   *Aesthetic:* Set to cool white (5600K) for day, or deep amber/red for "Primal" night shots.
*   **Stabilization:** **Human Hands + "Ninja Walk"**
    *   *No Gimbal:* Gimbals are sterile. Handheld adds grit and urgency.
    *   *Technique:* Keep elbows locked to ribs. Move with your knees.
*   **Editing App:** **CapCut (Mobile)**
    *   *Filter:* "Black & White 3" or a custom preset with High Contrast (+15), Low Saturation (-20), High Sharpening (+10).
    *   *Font:* Bold, sans-serif (e.g., "Anton" or "Montserrat ExtraBold") in pure white or neon yellow.

## 3. The "Day 1" Drop: Launch Batch Shot List

**Target:** 3 Reels to populate the Top Row immediately.

### Reel 1: The Manifesto (Identity)
*   **Hook:** "The modern world is a cage." (Voiceover).
*   **Visuals:**
    *   0:00-0:02: Fast montage of concrete city/traffic (Desaturated).
    *   0:02-0:05: Cut to black. Sound of heavy breathing.
    *   0:05-0:10: Slow-motion shot of you lifting a heavy stone/log or sprinting on a beach. High contrast "Tropical Noir."
*   **Audio:** Deep, rhythmic drum beat. No cheery pop music.
*   **Caption:** "Return to what is real. #BrazilianPrimal"

### Reel 2: The Skill (Competence)
*   **Hook:** Pure visual competence. No talking.
*   **Visuals:**
    *   A single, complex movement executed perfectly (e.g., a perfect muscle-up, a heavy kettlebell snatch, a precise jiu-jitsu sweep).
    *   Filmed from a low angle (power position).
    *   Raw audio of the exertion/impact.
*   **Text Overlay:** "Form is function." -> Fades out.
*   **Caption:** "Efficiency isn't an option. It's the standard."

### Reel 3: The Vibe (Aesthetic Anchor)
*   **Hook:** Atmosphere. Sensory details.
*   **Visuals:**
    *   Macro shots: Sweat on skin, callused hands, rust on a weight, leaves in the jungle.
    *   Lighting: Moody, evening light. Silhouettes.
*   **Audio:** Rain sounds + lo-fi hip hop beat.
*   **Text Overlay:** "Build the body. Sharpen the mind."
*   **Caption:** "My sanctuary. Where do you train?"

## 4. Traction Signals: Week 1 Metrics

**Ignore:** Likes. Likes are vanity.
**Ignore:** New Followers (initially).

**Focus Strictly On:**

1.  **Retention Rate (Watch Time):**
    *   *Goal:* >3 seconds average view duration on Reels.
    *   *Signal:* If they aren't staying for 3 seconds, the "Hook" failed.
2.  **Save Rate (The "Library" Effect):**
    *   *Metric:* Saves > Likes implies *utility*.
    *   *Signal:* Users save things they want to *use* later. High saves = you are a resource, not just entertainment.
3.  **Share Ratio:**
    *   *Metric:* Shares / Likes.
    *   *Signal:* If this is high (>10%), you have touched a nerve. People share to signal *their own* identity ("This is me").
4.  **DM Conversations:**
    *   *Goal:* 5 genuine DMs.
    *   *Signal:* "Brazilian Primal" is a tribe. Tribes talk. If people are DMing you to ask "What is this?" or "How do I start?", you have won.
