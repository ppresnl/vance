Yes, exactly.

From the Content Bible list you just pasted, here is the Exact 3-Post Sequence to test the concept immediately.

1. Day 1: The Visual Hook (Atmosphere)

• Select Item #15: "Climbing a street lamp like a coconut tree. Caption: The Urban Jungle."
• Why: It creates the "Tropical Cyberpunk" contrast immediately. Nature movement on city infrastructure.
• Goal: Does the aesthetic stop the scroll?

2. Day 2: The Competence (Viral Skill)

• Select Item #4: Hook: "Gravity doesn't care about your feelings." Visual: Precision jump gap.
• Why: It’s a pure "Stoic Lab" stunt. High consequence, zero fluff.
• Goal: Does the skill get shares/saves?

3. Day 3: The Soul (Connection)

• Select Item #27: Script: "My hands look like this so my soul can look like this." (Close up of callouses -> Cut to smile).
• Why: It validates the "Anatomy of Fear" / Depth angle without being a lecture.
• Goal: Does the meaning generate comments?

The Production Load:

• One Afternoon. You can film all three of these in 2 hours at one location (a street with a lamp/wall/gap).
• One Edit Session.

If these three work, the concept is proven. Then you scale to the rest of the list.
